For the implementation of the project i used an esp32 microcontroller, a lcd screen,
a DHT-11 sensor that measures the temperature and humidity of the surrounding air
and a LED light bulb. The data were transferred to a cloud platform called Thinger.io,
where while using a dashboard i visualized the data of the sensor and the real-time control 
of the LED light bulb.
